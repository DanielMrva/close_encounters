## Description
Everyone, even the most skeptical, has had moments where they've experienced something they can't explain. It could be something you saw in the night sky or maybe it was a chill when you entered a room. Close Encounters is a social media platform designed for us to catalog and share these experiences. It allows us to see where these events are happening and how many people have experienced the same one as well.

## Usage
Within the app you are required to login or generate a new account. Trying to access any aspect aside from the map will prompt you to do this, or you can click the icon in the top right. Within the app you can go to your user profile, enter a new event, and look at the map of events.
