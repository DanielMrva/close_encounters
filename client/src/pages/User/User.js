                  Time loss is a common symptom of close proximity to
                  anti-gravity systems that utilize bends in space and time for
                  the propulsion of UFOs. (TXF: "Dreamland") A residual
                  variation in time can occasionally be detected when
                  transversing areas of space exposed to a UFO. (TXF: "E.B.E.")

                  The effects of such exposure will usually persist within an
                  exposed area until the space-time continuum has fully healed
                  back to its original curvature. (TXF: "E.B.E.", "Dreamland
                  II") People who claim to have been abducted by UFOs or have
                  made UFO sightings have commonly reported unexplained time
                  loss. However, in the early 1990s, science maintained that
                  time could not simply disappear as it was a universal
                  invariant. (TXF: "Pilot"){" "}
